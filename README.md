Virtual Machine Performance VS Host Machine Performance report explored Virtual Machine (VM) technologies by executing a
performance-sensitive application on a laptop or desktop. By comparing the execution time of the application on the host 
operating system and within a virtual machine helped gain insights into the performance differences between these environments.

Virtual Machine Performance VS Container Performance report explored Docker Containerization technologies by executing a performance
sensitive application on a laptop or desktop. By comparing the execution time of the application on a Virtual Machine and a Docker Container
helped gain insights into the performance differences between these environments.
